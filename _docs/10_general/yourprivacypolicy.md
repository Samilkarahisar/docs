## Should you update your PP if you install our analytics solution on your website?

We are a privacy first product, which is why we made everything necessary to be able to respond to this with a simple "No you don't have to".

Indeed, officially there is no need to add us to your Privacy Policy because Simple Analytics doesn't store IP adresses or any other personal identifiable information.

We also don’t use cookies, so we don’t need to be added to your cookie banner either.
For more information on what we collect(and mostly what we don't) here is the related documentation page: https://simpleanalytics.com/what-we-collect

Still we advise our customers to mention us in their privacy policy and let their visitors know that they use a privacy friendly analytics tool which does not collect any personal identifiable information.
