We do this via an extension so we don't need to record IP addresses. It basically blocks requests on websites where you give permission for.

When you click on the icon you as asked to allow the extension to load the data from the current website. This is needed to block the visits. You need to do once this per website.

When a visits is blocked it shows up as a counter on the icon. The counter does reset when you close your tab. For more stats of blocked visits you can go to the options page.
